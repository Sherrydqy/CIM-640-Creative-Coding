# Title
### Attention

# Idea
## 3 potential ideas
I only have 2 potential ideas
* map different brainwave level to different music note and make them a song
* use attention of users to change things from disordered to ordered

## Final Idea:
#### we all live in a world full of distractions. There are tons of things lying in wait to distract us from our ultimate goal. Focusing on one thing becomes harder. But do we know how powerful our attention would be if we can fully focus? Therefore, I had this idea.
* Experience 1: At first, things will scattered all over the place while moving in different directions, representing the chaos of the world.
* Experience 2: While users become more focused, things will gradually gather together. Everything will become ordered gradually.
* Experience 3: If users cannot keep focusing, things will become scatter again.

I did not find any examples that influence my project. It's just an idea that popped up all of a sudden.

# Explanation:
## Why are you making this project? What is your motivation?
#### I am doing this project because I really want to dive into the interaction with computer and people's emotion and mood. My motivation is that sometimes I cannot focus very well. So I want to create something to visualize users' attention. To show people how powerful their attention could be.

## What are your inputs?
#### My input is the user's brainwave value detected by Brainwave headset from Neurosky.

## What are your outputs?
#### My outputs are:
- the movement of the balls: when the value of attention goes higher, each ball will rotating slower and all the balls will gather together gradually and finally form a circle around the red spot in the center. When users' attention decrease, the balls will become scattered again.
- the sound: as users' attention increases, the background sound becomes louder. When all the balls form a circle around the red spot, there will be random lines showing up representing the cracking of the screen. At the mean time, users can hear the sound of cracking.
- the color of the ball: at first, the balls have different colors. As they gather together, their colors become same gradually.
- when users' attention keeps at a high value for a while, all the lines will disappear representing the screen is breaking. Then all the balls become scattered again.

## Who is the target audience for your project?
#### Majorly kids. To show them how powerful their attention could be.

## Where will your project be displayed?
#### Museum. It's a very simple yet attractive project to show the power of attention. It can be a good choice for museum installation.

## Use a library
#### I used the sound library.
