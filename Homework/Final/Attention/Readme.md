# Title
### Attention

# Explanation:
## Why are you making this project? What is your motivation?
#### I am doing this project because I really want to dive into the interaction with computer and people's emotion and mood. My motivation is that sometimes I cannot focus very well. So I want to create something to visualize users' attention. To show people how powerful their attention could be.

## What are your inputs?
#### My input is the user's brainwave value detected by Brainwave headset from Neurosky.

## What are your outputs?
#### My outputs are:
- the movement of the balls: when the value of attention goes higher, each ball will rotating slower and all the balls will gather together gradually and finally form a circle around the red spot in the center. When users' attention decrease, the balls will become scattered again.
- the sound: as users' attention increases, the background sound becomes louder. When all the balls form a circle around the red spot, there will be random lines showing up representing the cracking of the screen. At the mean time, users can hear the sound of cracking.
- the color of the ball: at first, the balls have different colors. As they gather together, their colors become same gradually.
- when users' attention keeps at a high value for a while, all the lines will disappear representing the screen is breaking. Then all the balls become scattered again.

## Who is the target audience for your project?
#### Majorly kids. To show them how powerful their attention could be.

## Where will your project be displayed?
#### Museum. It's a very simple yet attractive project to show the power of attention. It can be a good choice for museum installation.

## Use a library
#### I used the sound library.
