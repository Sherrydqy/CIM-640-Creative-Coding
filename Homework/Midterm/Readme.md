## Why are you making this project? What is your motivation?
  >I had a hard time figuring out what I should do. And then there was a day when I went downstairs and stood in front of my cabinet the fifth time in the morning looking for something to eat. I usually keep my cabinet free of snacks because I know I can not help eating them if I have them. Then this idea hit me:"I am going to make a character of myself with my favorite food. She has to escape from bombardment of those rich food in case she gains too much weight. It is going to be fun!"

## What are your inputs?
> Buttons
  - After 6:00 a.m, you can click the button to wake her up.

> MouseX MouseY
  - When she is trying to avoid waffles, you can move the mouse to control her movement

> mousePressed
  - You can tap her belly to wake her up. But she will not be happy with that.

> keyPressed
  - You can press SPACE if you want more time to play with the food. Normally you will have 10 secs to play that section.

> hitzones
  - Her body is a hitzone. Like I mentioned, you can tap her belly to try to wake her up.


## What are your outputs?
- Her facial expressions would change to angry if you wake her up too early.
- Instruction words will change.
- She can move.
- If she eats a waffle(which is when she touches a waffle),this waffle will disappear. And she will become fatter(bigger)
- The time left will increase if you press SPACE when avoiding waffles.
- You will know how much weight she have gained after the play section. The bigger the waffle is, the more weight she will gain. The more waffles she eats, the more weight she will gain.


## Who is the target audience for your project?
> Anyone who wants to relax or wants to lose weight like me.
Hopefully anybody who wants to lose weight but can't help eating can realize that it's necessary to say goodbye to snacks and start to work out.

## Where will your project be displayed?
> Internet.
